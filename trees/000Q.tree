\title{The wild category of categories}
\p{
	We postulate a locally small \em{#{\infty}-category object}
	(in the external category of types),
	i.e. an infinitely coherent wild category, \Cat.
}
\p{
	Objects of \Cat are called \em{categories} and
	morphisms in \Cat are called \em{functors}.
}
\p{
	For #{C, D : \Cat}, we denote the type of
	functors from #{C} to #{D} by
	#{\map(C,D)}.
}
