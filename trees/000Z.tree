\title{\Cat has finite products}
\p{
	From the facts that #{\Cat} has a [terminal object](000T)
    and [pullbacks](000Y), it is easy to show that
	#{\Cat} has binary products, and more generally arbitrary
	finite products.
}
\p{
	Explicitly, for any finite set #{I}
	(meaning, we have #{n : \mathbb N} and
#{\lVert I \simeq [n] \rVert})
	and #{A : I \to \Cat}, the product #{\Pi_I A} exists.
